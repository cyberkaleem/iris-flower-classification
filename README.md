# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

## Project Description
This project is part of my Week 1 internship task at NSP Nexus. It classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

## Steps Performed
1. Dataset Loading
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Visualization
4. Model Training (KNN Classifier)
5. Model Evaluation

## Final Result
The model successfully classifies the iris flowers with good accuracy.
